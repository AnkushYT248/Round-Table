# Round Table

Round Table is a free, open-source learning platform inspired by sites like GeeksforGeeks and W3Schools. It is designed to help learners master programming, prepare for interviews, and build real-world projects—all in one place.

## Why This Website?

I created this project as a way to challenge and showcase my skills in both frontend and backend development. The goal is to provide a modern, user-friendly resource for anyone who wants to learn programming, practice coding, and explore new technologies, all for free.

## Features
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, responsive design with light and dark themes.
- **Courses & Tutorials**: Structured learning paths for popular languages and technologies.
- **Code Examples & Online Compiler**: Try out code in multiple languages directly in the browser.
- **Practice Problems**: Coding challenges and interview prep (planned).
- **Explore Section**: Discover language overviews and use-cases.
- **Community & Support**: (Planned) Blog, FAQ, and contact resources.
